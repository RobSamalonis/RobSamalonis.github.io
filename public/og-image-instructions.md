To complete the SEO setup, create an Open Graph image with these specifications:

## Image Requirements
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels (Facebook/LinkedIn optimal size)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File name**: `og-image.jpg` (place in public directory)
- **File size**: Under 1MB for optimal loading

## Content to Include
- **Name**: "Robert Samalonis"
- **Title**: "Senior Software Engineer"
- **Key Technologies**: "React | TypeScript | Accessibility"
- **Background**: Professional design with emo/scene aesthetic (deep blacks, vibrant accents)

## Tools for Creation
- Canva (easiest, has social media templates)

- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free alternative)

## Current Status
The SEO meta tags are already configured to use `/og-image.jpg`. Once you create and place the image file, the SEO implementation will be complete.
